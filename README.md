This repository contains a collection of data analysis and machine learning projects that I have worked on. Projects are implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and includes a detailed analysis of the dataset, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training and evaluation.

## Contents

The repository currently contains the following projects:

* [Pima Indians Diabetes Analysis](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VFcwTnQpMqalLZE9TLXtrteFCU8EXeQQ?usp=sharing): An analysis of the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset using machine learning techniques to predict diabetes in Pima Indian women.


* [Movie Recommendation System](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Y1Cinq-4KvPx8d0Iw2z-xSqoHH4hX_2q?usp=sharing): An implementation of a collaborative filtering-based recommendation system to provide personalized movie recommendations to users.


* [NYC Taxi Trip Duration Prediction](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aTex8IEPnkWFAMOZiUKfg-275lOxGHDX?usp=sharing): An analysis of the New York City Taxi trip duration dataset and the use of machine learning models to predict the duration of taxi trips based on various features.

* [Cryotherapy as a Treatment Method](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bi0a2ccj-OMbci6p0uxxOmT5lXTib_SX/view?usp=sharing): An analysis of the effectiveness of Cryotherapy to treat benign surface level growths on the skin. Linear regression and random forests are used to determine which variable predictors demonstrate a statistically significant relationship to the result of the treatment.

* [Heart Disease Prediction](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fbiQW8iZwXQHK_EQtP5PY_E3RM1UC4zo/view?usp=sharing): Research paper predicting heart disease based on 11 features by implementing supervised learning methods-KNN and SVM.
