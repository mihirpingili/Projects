# Projects

This repository contains a collection of data analysis and machine learning projects that I have worked on. Projects are implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and includes a detailed analysis of the dataset, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training and evaluation.

## Contents

The repository currently contains the following projects:

* [Pima Indians Diabetes Analysis](https://github.com/mihirpingili/Projects/blob/main/Pima_Indians_Diabetes_Analysis_Notebook.ipynb): An analysis of the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset using machine learning techniques to predict diabetes in Pima Indian women.

* [Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/mihirpingili/Projects/blob/main/Project_Movie_Recommendation_Notebook.ipynb): An implementation of a collaborative filtering-based recommendation system to provide personalized movie recommendations to users.

* [NYC Taxi Trip Duration Prediction](https://github.com/mihirpingili/Projects/blob/main/Project_NYC_Taxi_trip_duration_Notebook.ipynb): An analysis of the New York City Taxi trip duration dataset and the use of machine learning models to predict the duration of taxi trips based on various features.

* [Cryotherapy as a Treatment Method](https://github.com/mihirpingili/Projects/blob/main/Cryotherapy%20as%20a%20Treatment%20Method.pdf): An analysis of the effectiveness of Cryotherapy to treat benign surface level growths on the skin. Linear regression and random forests are used to determine which variable predictors demonstrate a statistically significant relationship to the result of the treatment.

## Usage

Apart from the one project that is a pdf file each is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. The notebooks include detailed explanations and code comments to guide the reader through the analysis process.

The datasets used in the projects are included in the repository, along with the necessary libraries and dependencies required to run the notebooks.
